st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
Now complete with scrollback patch and custom keybindings.

Custom Keybindings
----------
Zoom:
 * Up    - M-equals
 * Down  - M-minus
    (why equals and minus? They're actually
    the defaults for iTerm2)
 * Reset - M-S-h

Scroll
 * Up    - M-u
 * Down  - M-d
Shift-Mouse up/down can also scroll up/down respectively.

Credits
-------
All credit to the hardworking and dedicated suckless team.
